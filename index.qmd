## About the workshop

This workshop is designed as a quick introduction to the [R](https://r-project.org) programming language via [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [quarto](https://quarto.org/). The R programming language is widely used in the scientific community, with special emphasis on data analysis and visualization. The ggplot2 R package is a powerful data-visualization tool that makes using R pleasant. And quarto is a modern publishing system that allows you to create beautiful documents, presentations, and websites using R.

The workshop assumes the attendees will have reviewed the contents of the following materials:

- Posit cloud essentials ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fzwm4ZhVQQ)).
- Chapter 1 of the book “R for Data Science” (Hadley Wickham and others) ([link](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html)).
- Get started with Quarto ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew)).

All the workshop materials are available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/intro-r-ggplot2-quarto){target="_blank"}.
